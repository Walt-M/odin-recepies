        <li>In a medium bowl, mash the beef with the baking soda and salt</li>
        <li>Let sit for at least 15 minutes or up to 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Heat the oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat until hot and shimmering.</li>
        <li>Add the onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 4 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the garlic and cook 1 minute more. Do not brown.</li>
        <li>Add the beef, chili powder, cumin, coriander, paprika, oregano, and cayenne pepper and cook, stirring constantly and breaking meat up with a wooden spoon, until the beef is no longer pink, about 5 minutes.</li> 
        <li>Add the tomato sauce, water, sugar, and lime juice; bring to a simmer.</li>
        <li>Reduce the heat to medium-low and cook, uncovered, stirring frequently and breaking up the meat, until the liquid has reduced and thickened (the mixture should not be completely dry), 10 to 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Taste and adjust seasonings if necessary.</li>
        <li>Using a wide, shallow spoon, divide the filling evenly among the taco shells; place two or three tacos on individual plates.</li>
